\# Student Performance Analyzer – Data Analysis Project



\## 📌 Overview

The Student Performance Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis project that evaluates student academic performance using structured datasets.  

It computes total marks, averages, pass/fail status, grades, and identifies top performers — including handling tie cases accurately.



This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning, analysis, and reporting using Pandas.
